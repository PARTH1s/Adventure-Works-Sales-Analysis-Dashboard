#exceldashboard 
Hello everyone!
I am excited to share my recent project to practice on creating dashboard using MS Excel. It is a two-page interactive dashboard.

I used the AdventureWorks Sample database 

Project Overview:

o  Dataset consists of 6 Tables : FactInternetSales, DimProduct, DimDate, DimSalesTerritory, DimCustomer, DimGeography
o  4 Years of transactional data 
o  Two Page Dashboard – Time Series Analysis and Product-Customer Analysis

Objective

 To identify the key sales metrics and record this data in visual dashboards emphasizing on identifying the trends in profitability, top performing products and customer based on geography

Key Learning

·       Analyzed Year on Year profitability on key metrics like Quantity, transaction, COGS, Revenue, Profit
·       Identified the years performing above average on a whole
·       Identified Profit trends and percentage change over the quarter 
·       Drilled down to Top 3 profitable months of total profit of a particular year
·       Further drilled down Top 3 Profitable days of the week 
·       Top 5 profitable products and customers, their contribution to the overall profit
·       Saleability of the product
·       Profit contribution from the expensive and less expensive product
·       Profit distribution by colour
·       Gender based profit breakdown
·       Profit contribution by age group and identified the most contributing age group
·       Top 2 location wise sales contribution through custom map visual

Throughout this project, I had a chance to learn the following advanced topics in depth,

·       Used PowerQuery to model and load the required data from the raw dataset. Few topics like
o  Conditional column to categorize Weekday/Weekend, Age Groups, Expensive/less expensive
o  Added custom column using M Codes – To fetch the Age of customers with respective to current date
·       Used PowerPivot to create and manage relationships and created measures using DAX functions.
o  Distinct Count | Sum | Divide | Average | CountRows 
·       MS Excel Functions like 
o  If and IFS | Index and Match | Max | Large | Sum
o  Use of button and linked it to a cell and a chart
o  Slicers
o  Recorded Macro to clear filters
